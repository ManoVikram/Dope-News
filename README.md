# Dope News

A news app built with Flutter by fetching data from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). It uses BLoC architecture to interact with the API endpoints with data providers, repositories and update the app's state accordingly. The swipe card animation makes it more fun and intuitive to use the app.
